Congratulations to Dante for passing his doctoral viva voce examination on Monday, 9th December 2019, with Professor David Freedman (internal) as examiners. Dante's thesis used electrophysiological recordings from non human primate to investigate the emergent properties of neural networks during working memory and decision making tasks.
