We are working to understand how the brain performs the computations necessary for adaptive, intelligent behaviour. Most of our experiments focus on two core cognitive functions: attention and working memory. We measure human brain activity with high temporal and spatial resolution using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Working with our collaborators in Oxford and further afield, we also explore brain activity recorded directly with intracranial electrodes. By exploiting convergent methodologies, we are better able to overcome specific limitations inherent to any single approach.

The results of our research will provide a richer understanding of the fundamental neural mechanisms of attention and working memory, how they interact and how they influence perception and decision-making. Insights gained from this research will help inform neurophysiological accounts of high-level cognition, and help to develop new computational models grounded by the neurophysiology.
