As part of my DPhil in Neuroscience, I am investigating how visual attention is influenced by learning experiences. Specifically, my research looks at how associating visual stimuli with reward in one context biases attentional selection of those stimuli in other contexts. I use neuroimaging methods such as MEG and fMRI to probe the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction. I completed a BSc in Psychology Research at the University of Toronto and an MSc in Neuroscience at the University of Oxford. Outside of the lab, I enjoy photography, trying new food, and artsy movies.</div>

			I am a DPhil student (2017) supervised by Mark Stokes and Kia Nobre. My research focusses on how top-down control refines perceptual representations in working memory and perception. To this end, I use neuroimaging data from different modalities (EEG, MEG, and fMRI) and apply neurocomputational models and machine learning to analyse the data. Prior to starting my DPhil, I completed my BSc in Psychobiology and MSc in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. In my free time, I enjoy food, taking up challenges such as learning to play the piano, and training as well as competing with the triathlon club and cross country club.

			A first-year DPhil with a background in Neuroscience. I am broadly interested in understanding what allows humans to act flexibly in new environments. More specifically, my research looks at how prior knowledge can be leveraged to improve the speed and efficiency of learning and decision making processes. To investigate this, I use non-invasive brain imaging and behavioural testing of healthy human participants. Outside of the lab, I am a passionate tea drinker.

			My research focuses on our remarkable capacity for flexible, goal-directed behaviour. As part of my doctoral work, I look at how motivation modulates neural coding patterns to support cognitive control processes, such as our ability to rapidly update abstract rules. I also examine how people decide when to disengage from actions that are no longer rewarding, using EEG/fMRI to pursue my research questions. I received my BSc(Hons) in Neuroscience from the University of Otago in New Zealand before gaining funding from the Rutherford Foundation and William Georgetti Trust to pursue my PhD at Oxford. When I’m not in the lab, you’ll find me practicing triathlon, writing or spending time in the sun.

			My DPhil explores how information is selected and prioritized in working memory, using methods such as human behavior and neuroimaging (EEG/MEG), as well as analysis of monkey local field potentials (LFPs). My current project focuses on how different visual features of objects are bound together in working memory when they are attended or unattended. I completed a BA in Psychology and Philosophy at University of Oxford and since worked as a Research Assistant at the UCL Institute for Child Health and at Warwick University Medical School before returning to Oxford for my DPhil. When I’m not in the lab I enjoy bread-making, photography and going for runs along the river.
