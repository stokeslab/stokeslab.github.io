As part of my DPhil in Neuroscience, I am investigating how visual attention is influenced by learning experiences. Specifically, my research looks at how associating visual stimuli with reward in one context biases attentional selection of those stimuli in other contexts. I use neuroimaging methods such as MEG and fMRI to probe the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction. I completed a BSc in Psychology Research at the University of Toronto and an MSc in Neuroscience at the University of Oxford. Outside of the lab, I enjoy photography, trying new food, and artsy movies.</div>

	                I am <b>Associate Professor</b> in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, <b> Tutorial Fellow</b> in Psychology at the New College and <b>Head</b> of the Attention and Working Memory Lab. My research explores the role of selective attention in perception, working memory and flexible decision-making. I am particularly interested in how these core cognitive functions are integrated for goal-directed adaptive behaviour.

I use fMRI, EEG, and intracranial brain recordings to study how humans form structured representations of the world that afford flexible behaviour and generalisation of past experience to new situations.

			I joined the lab as a <b>Post-Doc</b> fellow funded by the Fondation Fyssen in January 2019. My main research interest lies in dissecting the neuro-cognitive architecture of working memory, our brain's ability to store and manipulate information in the service of adaptive, flexible, and intelligent behavior. To this end, I employ a mixture of behavioral techniques, neuroimaging (i.e., fMRI) and electrophysiological methods (i.e., [i]EEG/MEG), as well as machine learning algorithms. Prior to my work here, as part of my PhD with Stanislas Dehaene (Paris, France), I explored the cognitive and neural characteristics and features of a newly discovered phenomenon: non-conscious working memory. When I am not in the lab, I enjoy cooking (and eating) dishes from different cultures and cuisines, listening to and playing music (either on my recorder or my guitar), and traveling to (foreign) cities and countries. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dtruebutschek/" target="_blank"><b>Link</b></a>

	                I am a <b>Post-Doc</b> interested in exploring brain activity and its role in cognition. I am particularly interested in the mechanisms of selective attention and working memory, and how these functions and their interactions are supported, regulated and reflected in neural activity. The main goal of my post-doc is to test a new conceptual model of working memory using a combination of computational modeling simulations and analysis of behavioural and neurophysiological data.

			As part of my <b>DPhil</b>, I am interested in the complex neural dynamics underlying working memory and cognitive learning mechanisms. I use high resolution neural population recordings from animals and inter-cranial recordings from human participants to investigate how neural dynamics unfold as we actively remember, manipulate or learn bits of information.

			My <b>DPhil</b> research focuses on our remarkable capacity for flexible, goal-directed behaviour. As part of my doctoral work, I look at how motivation modulates neural coding patterns to support cognitive control processes, such as our ability to rapidly update abstract rules. I also examine how people decide when to disengage from actions that are no longer rewarding, using EEG/fMRI to pursue my research questions. I received my BSc(Hons) in Neuroscience from the University of Otago in New Zealand before gaining funding from the Rutherford Foundation and William Georgetti Trust to pursue my PhD at Oxford. When I’m not in the lab, you’ll find me practicing triathlon, writing or spending time in the sun.

			My <b>DPhil</b> explores how information is selected and prioritized in working memory, using methods such as human behavior and neuroimaging (EEG/MEG), as well as analysis of monkey local field potentials (LFPs). My current project focuses on how different visual features of objects are bound together in working memory when they are attended or unattended. I completed a BA in Psychology and Philosophy at University of Oxford and since worked as a Research Assistant at the UCL Institute for Child Health and at Warwick University Medical School before returning to Oxford for my DPhil. When I’m not in the lab I enjoy bread-making, photography and going for runs along the river.

			I am a <b>DPhil</b> student (2017) supervised by Mark Stokes and Kia Nobre. My research focusses on how top-down control refines perceptual representations in working memory and perception. To this end, I use neuroimaging data from different modalities (EEG, MEG, and fMRI) and apply neurocomputational models and machine learning to analyse the data. Prior to starting my DPhil, I completed my BSc in Psychobiology and MSc in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. In my free time, I enjoy food, taking up challenges such as learning to play the piano, and training as well as competing with the triathlon club and cross country club.

			A second-year <b>DPhil</b> student with a background in Neuroscience. I am broadly interested in understanding what allows humans to act flexibly in new environments. More specifically, my research looks at how prior knowledge can be leveraged to improve the speed and efficiency of learning and decision making processes. To investigate this, I use non-invasive brain imaging and behavioural testing of healthy human participants. Outside of the lab, I am a passionate tea drinker.

			I am a PhD student at the Timing and Cognition Lab at Federal University of ABC (Brazil). The neural correlates of timing perception are my objects of study, which I investigate with EEG data. I am especially interested in correlates that arise when we compare durations to make judgements. As a <b> Visitor Student </b> in Stokes Lab, I aim to improve the analysis of my timing data with multivariate techniques. Outside the lab, I like enjoying a good literature book and gaming.
